Following data cleaning, two Scikit-Learn KNN models should be created
for two different distance metrics: Square Euclidean and Manhattan
distance. The performance of the two models using different distance
metrics should be compared in terms of accuracy to the test data and
Scikit-Learn Classification Report.
